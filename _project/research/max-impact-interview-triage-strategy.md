- Polish tech companies use algorithmic assessments (HackerRank usage)
- FAANG failure patterns show DSA as non-negotiable foundation

**Your Current State:**
- sanglogium focuses on business logic, limited algorithmic complexity
- No evidence of algorithmic problem-solving in codebase

**Interview Risk:** **CRITICAL** - Will fail technical screening
**Time to Competency:** 3-4 weeks focused practice
**ROI:** **MAXIMUM** - Unlocks all other opportunities

**Action Plan:**
- Platform: **AlgoMonster** (Google/FB engineers designed)
- Backup: **LeetCode** with Blind 75 problems
- Daily: 2 hours pattern recognition practice
- Focus: Arrays, strings, trees, graphs, dynamic programming

#### 2. TypeScript Mastery - **Priority #2**
**Evidence:**
- Your codebase: `image: any`, `gallery?: any[]` in getProductBySlug.ts
- Polish market: TypeScript required for senior roles
- Salary impact: 20-40% premium for TypeScript expertise

**Your Current State:**
- Using `any` types (senior-level red flag)
- Missing proper type safety in critical functions
- No advanced TypeScript patterns

**Interview Risk:** **CRITICAL** - Signals lack of senior expertise
**Time to Competency:** 2 weeks intensive
**ROI:** **HIGH** - Immediate salary differentiation

**Action Plan:**
- Replace all `any` types with proper interfaces
- Learn generics, utility types, conditional types
- Practice with sanglogium codebase as real examples

#### 3. Performance Optimization - **Priority #3**
**Evidence:**
- Your ProductPage: sequential data fetching (waterfall anti-pattern)
- Polish companies: performance-critical e-commerce focus
- Interview question: "Optimize this slow loading page"

**Your Current State:**
```tsx
// ANTI-PATTERN: Sequential fetching
const product = await getProductBySlug(slug);
const relatedProducts = await getRelatedProducts(product._id, ...);
```

**Interview Risk:** **CRITICAL** - Shows lack of performance awareness
**Time to Competency:** 1 week pattern learning
**ROI:** **HIGH** - Directly applicable to sanglogium

**Action Plan:**
- Implement Promise.all() for parallel fetching
- Learn React.memo, useMemo, useCallback patterns
- Study Next.js performance optimization

---

### 🔥 Category 2: HIGH IMPACT (Salary Differentiators)

#### 4. Next.js 15 Server Components - **Priority #4**
**Evidence:**
- Your codebase uses Next.js 15 but not modern patterns

- Interview differentiator vs React-only developers

**Your Current State:**
- Using Server Components but not leveraging full benefits
- Missing parallel data fetching patterns
- No streaming UI implementation

**Interview Risk:** **HIGH** - Missing modern framework expertise
**Time to Competency:** 2 weeks
**ROI:** **HIGH** - Senior-level differentiation

#### 5. System Design Fundamentals - **Priority #5**
**Evidence:**
- Senior roles (140,000+ PLN) require system design
- Polish companies: scaling architecture knowledge valued
- Interview round dedicated to system design

**Your Current State:**
- sanglogium shows good component architecture
- Missing distributed systems knowledge
- No caching strategy, database design experience

**Interview Risk:** **HIGH** - Senior-level gatekeeper
**Time to Competency:** 3 weeks
**ROI:** **MEDIUM** - Career advancement enabler

#### 6. React Patterns & Best Practices - **Priority #6**
**Evidence:**
- Your ImageGallery.tsx: decent useEffect cleanup
- Polish market: React expertise expected
- Interview focus on hooks, state management

**Your Current State:**
- Good useEffect patterns but could be optimized
- Missing advanced patterns (Context, custom hooks)
- No state management beyond basic useState

**Interview Risk:** **MEDIUM** - Framework expertise gap
**Time to Competency:** 2 weeks
**ROI:** **MEDIUM** - Framework mastery

## Counter-Evidence & Risk Assessment

### Common Interview Prep Mistakes (AVOID)
1. **LeetCode Grinding Without Patterns** - Low retention, poor application
2. **Framework-Specific Knowledge Only** - "Feature coder" anti-pattern
3. **Ignoring Fundamentals for Trendy Tech** - Unsustainable foundation

### Evidence Against Conventional Wisdom
**Claim:** "Focus on latest frameworks"  
**Counter-Evidence:** Polish companies still test DSA fundamentals heavily  
**Verdict:** Frameworks important, but DSA is gatekeeper

**Claim:** "Build projects instead of algorithms"  
**Counter-Evidence:** sanglogium exists but won't pass algorithmic screening  
**Verdict:** Both needed, but algorithms first
