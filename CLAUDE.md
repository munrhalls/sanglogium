## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## Architecture Overview

_Last reviewed 2026-08-01 against the live repo. Stack/pattern-level only — for implementation detail, read the actual files; this is not a substitute for that. Full tech stack list lives in `README.md` (kept there to avoid two copies drifting apart) — Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, Sanity v3, Stripe, Better Auth, Zustand, TypeScript/Zod, Playwright + Vitest._

**Top-level route/folder map** (`app/`): route groups `(store)` (public storefront), `(admin)`, `(studio)` (Sanity Studio), `(test)`; plus `checkout/`, `actions/` (server actions), `api/` (route handlers), `components/`, `lib/`, `hooks/`. Sanity queries live under `sanity-cms/` — never in `app/` (enforced check in the `sang-logium-review` skill).

**Catalogue pattern:** product catalogue uses a "Build-Time VFS" pattern (see `data/catalogue.ts`, `catalogue-code-record.md`) — headless CMS data pre-materialized at build time for sub-second navigation, rather than live-queried per request. Relevant when touching catalogue/product-listing performance or data-freshness questions.

**Workflow note:** this repo runs an AI-assisted pipeline — Claude does planning/task breakdown, Devin executes implementation (see `orchestration-plan.md`, `_project/devin-cloud-optimization-plan.md`) — and issue tracking is `bd`/beads, not TODO files (see above).
